            <h3>Choka Zilla</h3>
            <p>Choke-a-zilla was once a small and unassuming artichoke farmer, until one day he was exposed to a strange chemical that caused him to mutate into a giant artichoke monster. At first, Choke-a-zilla was scared of his new form and hid away from the world. But eventually, he learned to embrace his powers and use them for good. He now spends his days protecting artichoke farms from harm and using his strength to help those in need. Despite his fearsome appearance, Choke-a-zilla has a heart of gold and is beloved by all who know him. </p>
